## The Universal Second Language: Why Everyone Should Learn Coding
## 宇宙的第二语言:为什么每个人都应该学习写代码

![start coding](http://schoolpot.qiniudn.com/start-coding.jpg)

>译者注:在阅读本文之前需要提示的是写代码与编程是不同的概念,编程是一个更为广义的概念,意为:为解决一个问题而去创造出抽象化的解决方案。

A couple of years ago, when someone asked why he or she should learn programming, the answer was simple: To get a good job with a high salary.

几年前,当有人问到为什么他(她)该学习编程,答案是简单的,为了找一份高薪的工作。


During the 21st century, coding has become a core job skill. Computer skills are now essential, even if you’ve already got a non-technical job.

在21世纪期间,编程已经变成一个工作中的核心技能。电脑知识已经变得至关重要,既是你的工作和电脑技术无关。

In this post, we'd like to share just a few reasons to consider taking a few minutes of your time to explore the positive effects knowing how to code can have on your career - and on your life outside of work, as well.

在本文当中,我们来分享这么几个理由,让你花费数分钟去思考编程与了解它是如何在工作中甚至是在你的工作之余所产生的积极影响。

Gaining programming and coding skills will qualify you for dozens of new job opportunities, but besides that, it will enable you to...

获得编程和写代码的能力将会使你有资格获得更多工作机会但除此之外,它还会让你......
######...Improve Problem-Solving Skills
#####...提升你解决问题的能力

Even if you never become a professional software developer, you will benefit from knowing how to consider questions or issues as a coder would. You'll have the ability to understand and master technologies of all sorts and solve problems in almost any discipline.

尽管你从未成为过一个专业的软件开发者,你将会从如何像程序员一样去考虑一个问题或者事情中受益。你将会有能力在各个方面去理解并科学地规划事情、解决问题。


######...Change Your Way of Thinking
#####...改变你思考的方式

Steve Jobs once said, "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think."

Programming is a component of computer science, which helps in the development of critical thinking skills. Having such skills is extremely useful when the need for processing and presenting information and thinking analytically arises.
乔布斯曾经说过,"在这个国家,每个人都应该学习如何去编程,因为它教会你如何去思考"。
编程是计算机科学的一部分,它有助于锻炼缜密的思维能力。
有这样的技能是非常有用的尤其是当处理和展示信息与具有分析性地思考(逻辑思考)的需求产生的时候。

######...Create or Change Things
#####...创造和改变事物
The act of programming almost feels like you're "acting God-like"! In other words, you're creating your own world, complete with all of the features you want. You can turn the blank text file into a working program, with nothing to limit you but your imagination. Doesn’t that sound completely amazing?

当你在编程的时候你甚至会觉得自己像神一样！换言之,你在创造一个属于你自己的世界,并为此完成所有你需要的功能。你可以把一个空文本文件变成一个可工作的程序,除了你的想象力以外没有任何东西可以限制你,这难道不是一件听起来完完全全令你觉得惊讶的事情吗?

It's also great fun to see someone using your creation. Your ability to improve your life and the lives of your friends and family is limited only by your ideas once you can take full control of your computer.

让别人看到你的创造成果是非常有趣的一件事情,你用你的能力去改变你的生活,并且,你的朋友,家庭的生活亦因此而被你的创造所影响,然而这一切仅发生在你的电脑前。

######...Stay Competitive

#####...保持竞争力
Whether you want to give your career a boost, or you just think it's important to keep pace with the rest of the world, learning to code has never been more important or more accessible.

无论你是否想让你的事业获得帮助,或者你只是想平静地要一份稳定生活并遣度余生,学习写代码已经变得如此重要,面向大众。

Today's world is full of web services, and being familiar with computer science will help you stay competitive in the fast-growing digital economy.

在满是Web服务应用的今天,熟悉计算机科学将会帮助你在快速增长的数字化经济中保持竞争力。

Programming hasn't grown this popular "just because". There is a growing realization that knowing how to program is essential for everyone, and especially for the younger generation.

编程从来没有发展得如此想当然地受大众欢迎。越来越多的人意识到编程对每个人都是至关重要的,尤其是对于年轻的一代来说。

Early in 2015, President Obama asserted that making computer programming education a requirement in the public schools makes sense, and went on to further endorse the idea:

2015年的早些时候,总统奥巴马就宣称编程教学如同识字一样,应成为基础教育的一部分,并进一步说到:


Learning computer skills will change the way we do just about everything. Don't just buy a new video game, make one. Don't just download the latest app, help design it. No one is born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work, just about anyone can become one. And don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t.

学习电脑技能将会改变我们做任何事的方式。我们能做的不只是购买一个新的电子游戏,而是做一个,不只是下载一个最新的应用,而是帮助并改进、设计它。没人是天生的计算机科学家,但是通过稍微的努力,每个人都将成为可能。切勿听旁人说你不能实现自己的目标。

The idea that everyone should learn coding, which is widely regarded as the new universal second language, is not about creating a nation of coders who will create the next Twitter or Facebook. It's about tapping into everyone’s creativity and developing the invaluable skill of being able to solve problems.

每个人都应该学习编程,它是公认的宇宙里新兴的第二语言，这并不是说,创造一个每个人都会创造出下一个Twitter或者Facebook的编程帝国. 这是在说,每个人的创造力与它培养出具有无可估量的价值的解决问题的技能

Even if you have no plans to become a software engineer, spend a few weeks or months learning to code. It will sharpen your ability to troubleshoot and solve all sorts of problems.

尽管你并不打算去称为一个软件工程师,花费数周或者数个月去学习写代码。它(适量学习写代码学习编程掌握编程思想)会提高你排错和解决所有问题的能力。
