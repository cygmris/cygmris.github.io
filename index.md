## Understanding of Blog -translated from this theme's author

With the increasing data we'v been creating on the network, which is also our footprint on the internet,We have to treat it with our greatest sincere as our baby. But somehow, they are always seperated and distributed in several websites which make us hard to collect them together. Besides, we have no idea how to feel free to manage our info towards various websites. For the situation and consideration above, The Blog where we can totally dominate our own staff, have been walked in our life.

Moreover,  We can record our life and story in growth via bloging。It's neither fragmented as Twitter nor relational as Facebook. That is our own palace and private space.
